# Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors
Odin's Project - Foundation Course
The purpose of this project is to create a Javascript module of rock paper scissors. I will create the html code for the product that included a script and then link a Javascript file to the html. After I will make adjustments to the visuals of the game using css.
